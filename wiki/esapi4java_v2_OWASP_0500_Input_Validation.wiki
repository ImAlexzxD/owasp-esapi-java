==OWASP-0501 Not applicable==

The ASVS Level 1A requirement OWASP-0501 is not applicable, it is not a requirement that you'd use ESAPI to build to. Using Java actually is sufficient to meet this particular requirement given the Java language design.

==OWASP-0502 Code sample==

The ASVS requirement OWASP-0502 reads, "Verify that a positive validation pattern is defined and applied to all input."

Here is an example of how to use ESAPI for Java's configuration file and Validator to define and then to apply a positive validation pattern.

==OWASP-0503 Code sample==

The ASVS requirement OWASP-0503 reads, "Verify that all input validation failures result in input rejection or input sanitization."

Here is an example of how to determine if ESAPI for Java's Validator rejected input (i.e. if a validation failure occurred).
