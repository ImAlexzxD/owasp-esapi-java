  # Extend your common security control library with input validation functions for all inputs
  # Extend your common security control library with output encoding functions for all output contexts 
  # Test your common security control library input validation function from your framework
  # Test your common security control library output encoding function from your framework
  # Check off AppSec STIG requirements
