That was the main point that I was trying to get across as well Michael. While notification lists are important, having the process documented is *very* important.

Examples we can go off of:
http://germany.rsa.com/node.aspx?id=2928
http://httpd.apache.org/security_report.html
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html

Summary of what I think we need:

1. Any issues tagged with Security in Issue Tracker should be hidden to non-commiters (if possible)
2. A certificate available for download to allow researchers to encrypt vulnerability details that they e-mail to us
3. A notification list for security-alerts
4. Define an expected response time to resolve vulnerabilities
5. Do we go with CVE labels for vulnerabilities or use our own labeling system

I think that these 5 things should probably be owasp wide, and projects should be required to have a link on their *main pages* pointing people to the OWASP Policy for reporting Security Vulnerabilities.

The policy itself should be pretty standard, 

1. Send as much info as possible, including PoC code if available. 
2. Ask nicely to not disclose publicly until we have had a chance to respond and/or resolve
3, Encouraged use of OWASP cert to encrypt details of vuln in e-mail

We should have a central e-mail distribution that goes to project leads for all owasp projects (something along the lines of vulnerable@owasp.org) 

We should only encourage people to submit security vulnerabilities using Issue Trackers if we have the ability to *hide* those issues from anonymous and/or non project commiters.

Thoughts?
